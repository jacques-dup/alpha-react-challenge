# Question 1

## Instructions
Implement a basic counter that increments the `count` state value of the Question1 component.

1. The `Question1` component serves as the parent containing the state.
1. You must figure out a way to provide that state to the `<Button>` component in the same file, so that it can increment the counter using the `countHandler` function.
1. You must use the React Context provided in `./src/infrastructure/context` (already imported).
