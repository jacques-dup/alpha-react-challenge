# Alpha React Coding Challenge
This repository serves to test prospective Alpha Software Engineer's abilities in order to guage potential employment and placement.

## Setup

1. Install node v14+
1. Execute `npm start`

## Question Instructions
Inside of the `src` directory you will find 2 more directories as well as an `index.js` file.

1. You may not (should not have to) change any files inside of the `infrastructure/` directory. Inside you will find the test aplication container only.

1. Inside the `questions/` directory are 3 additional directories, each with their own `.js` file as well as a `README.md`. <br>
**A.** Your code is to be done within the relevant question's `.js` file.<br>
**B.** Instructions for each question can be found in it's relative `README.md` file.
